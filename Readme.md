## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Packages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suchael/call_mind_ai_help_desk
cd call_mind_ai_help_desk
npm install

### Update the .env file

Create a `/env` file, or copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

In the .env file, update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key from the **Prerequisites**.

## Run the app
Once ngrok is running, dependencies are installed, Twilio is configured properly, and the `.env` is set up, run the dev server with the following command:
```
node index.js
```
## Test the app
With the development server running, call the phone number you purchased in the **Prerequisites**. After the introduction, you should be able to talk to the AI Assistant. Have fun!

## Special features

### Interrupt handling/AI preemption
When the user speaks and OpenAI sends `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, the code will clear the Twilio Media Streams buffer and send OpenAI `conversation.item.truncate`.
